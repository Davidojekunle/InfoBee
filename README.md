okay  i want to add the following to it
to check if it is an exel or csv file and convert any of them to string 
take in the argument: a user_name 
where it will create  a subfolder inside the visuals  with the username and file name together and retrun all the images part in the foler eg
let 's say the username is string
it output will be like this

{visuals/string_sales_data/
all the image path under it}



##  Temperature Trends Across European Cities: A Data Analysis for Managers

This analysis examines temperature data from Antwerp, Paris, and London over a three-day period in May 2019.  

**Key Insights:**

* **Consistent Daytime Highs in London:** London experienced relatively consistent daytime temperatures, with a high of 36째C on May 8th and a low of 24째C on May 9th. 
* **Fluctuating Temperatures in Paris:** Paris exhibited significant temperature fluctuations, experiencing a high of 77.7째C on May 7th and a low of 10째C on May 9th. This suggests a more dynamic weather pattern in Paris compared to London.
* **Missing Data Points:** Notably, there are significant gaps in data for Antwerp, especially during the daytime hours. This limits our ability to draw conclusions about temperature trends in the city.
* **Potential for Data Collection Improvement:** This analysis highlights the need for more comprehensive and consistent data collection across all three cities to provide a complete picture of temperature trends.

**Potential Business Implications:**

* **Energy Consumption:** The fluctuating temperatures in Paris and the lack of data for Antwerp raise concerns regarding potential energy usage variations across cities. Understanding these variations can inform energy management strategies and potentially optimize energy consumption.
* **Tourism and Travel:** The consistent warm temperatures in London might attract tourists and travelers, impacting the city's tourism industry. Conversely, the unpredictable weather in Paris could require more flexibility in travel plans. 
* **Health and Well-being:** The data highlights the importance of monitoring temperature fluctuations to understand their potential impact on public health. This information can inform public health initiatives and emergency preparedness plans.

**Recommendations:**

* **Data Collection Enhancement:** Improve the data collection process for all cities to ensure consistent and complete data capture, allowing for a more detailed analysis.
* **Trend Analysis:** Once data gaps are addressed, conduct further analysis to identify specific temperature patterns and trends for each city.
* **Correlation Studies:** Explore potential correlations between temperature variations and other factors such as energy consumption, tourist activity, and health indicators.

**Overall, this analysis provides a preliminary overview of temperature trends across European cities. It underscores the importance of reliable and comprehensive data for informed decision-making in various business sectors and public health initiatives.**
